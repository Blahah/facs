Overview

New generation sequence technologies and the sequencing of increasingly
complex datasets demand new efficient and specialized sequence analysis
algorithms. Often, it is only the 'novel' sequences in a complex dataset that
are of interest and the superfluous sequences need to be removed. A novel
algorithm, FACS (Fast and Accurate Classification of Sequences), is introduced
that can accurately and rapidly align sequences to a reference sequence. FACS
was first optimized and validated using a synthetic metagenome dataset. An
experimental metagenome dataset was then used to show that FACS is at least
three times faster and more accurate than BLAT and SSAHA2 in classifying
sequences when using references larger than 50Mbp.
